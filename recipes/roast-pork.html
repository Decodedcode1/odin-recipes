    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>This is the best thing can happen to the piggy.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3 pound) boneless pork loin roast, trimmed of fat</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, divided</li>
        <li>8 small baby bella mushrooms, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried parsley</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>½ cup dry white wine
        <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease an 8x10-inch casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Make 1/2-inch slits in pork roast using a sharp knife. Slice 2 garlic cloves; place garlic slices into the slits in pork roast.</li>
        <li>Place mushrooms in the bottom of the prepared casserole dish. Sprinkle parsley, thyme, salt, and pepper over mushrooms; grate remaining garlic clove with a microplane grater over mushrooms.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; place pork in hot skillet and cook, turning, until lightly browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer pork to the casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Stir white wine and chicken stock together in a cup; pour into the skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon. Pour wine mixture over pork.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven until pork is slightly pink in the center, about 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Transfer roast to a warm serving dish; cover to keep warm.</li>
        <li>Pour drippings with mushroom mixture into a saucepan; bring to a boil and cook until liquid is reduced by half. Stir cornstarch into water until smooth; pour into drippings and cook until thickened, about 3 minutes. Slice pork roast and serve with mushroom pan sauce.</li>
    </ol>
